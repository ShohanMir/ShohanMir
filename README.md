# Hi there, I'm Shohan Mir ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dropout student and a full-stack developer with a passion for building web applications. I have experience with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, Django, Node.js, React, and more.

# Skills

# Other Skills

# Interests
Outside of programming, I enjoy playing football, watching movies, and trying out to learn new things everyday.

# Goals
In the future, I hope to continue building my skills to become an engineer rather than a developer on my own and work on projects that have a positive impact on the world. I'm also interested in exploring new technologies every single day and learning from other developers.

# Contact
Feel free to reach out to me at [shohan7mir@gmail.com] if you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work.
